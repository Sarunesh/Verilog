# Verilog
In this repos, I've included the codes that're written by me using Verilog HDL. 

## AND gate
Circuit diagram: https://github.com/Sarunesh/Verilog/blob/main/AND%20gate/Andgate.png

Description: Here, a & b are input ports and out is the output port. This code is written using DataFlow modelling.
Code: https://github.com/Sarunesh/Verilog/blob/main/AND%20gate/and_gate.v

## NOR gate

Description: Here, a & b are input ports and out is the output port. This code is written using Behavioral modelling.
Code: https://github.com/Sarunesh/Verilog/blob/main/NOR%20gate/nor_gate.v

## XNOR gate

Description: Here, a & b are input ports and out is the output port. This code is written using Behavioral modelling.
Code: https://github.com/Sarunesh/Verilog/blob/main/XNOR%20gate/xnor_gate.v

## IC7458
Circuit diagram: https://github.com/Sarunesh/Verilog/blob/main/IC7458/7458.png
Description: The 7458 is a chip with four AND gates and two OR gates. This code is written using Gate level modelling.
Code: https://github.com/Sarunesh/Verilog/blob/main/IC7458/ic7458.v
