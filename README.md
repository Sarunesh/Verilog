# Verilog
In this repos, I've included the codes that're written by me using Verilog HDL. 

## AND gate
Circuit diagram: https://github.com/Sarunesh/Verilog/blob/main/AND%20gate/Andgate.png
Description: Here, a & b are input ports and out is the output port. This code is written using DataFlow modelling.
Code: https://github.com/Sarunesh/Verilog/blob/main/AND%20gate/and_gate.v

## NOR gate

Description: Here, a & b are input ports and out is the output port. This code is written using Behavioral modelling.
Code: https://github.com/Sarunesh/Verilog/blob/main/NOR%20gate/nor_gate.v

## XNOR gate
